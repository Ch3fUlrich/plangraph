"""D-217 waiver verb for :class:`plangraph.keeper.store.Store`.

The two-reviewer gate (D-219, ``store_review``) normally requires the second
passing verdict to come from a different family.  When that seat is unavailable
the router may record a **verified ``decision``** that waives the second-family
requirement for one item: after ``waive_second_family(principal, key, D-NNN)``
the two passing verdicts may share a family.  Distinct principals, non-null
families and the claimant/delegate exclusion all still apply — the waiver only
relaxes *which families* count.

Like ``add_evidence_router`` the slow decision verification runs before the
write lock, and the row is re-read and guarded inside ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``.

Only a ``high`` item has a second family to waive (D-228): waiving a
``standard`` or ``none`` item is refused ``bad_state``.

The decision does not waive on its own: its D-row must carry the whole token
``Waives: <key>`` for the item being waived (X6c3), checked through the
``decisions`` adapter in that same pre-lock I/O.
